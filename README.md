## Hi, I’m Arvind

I design and operationalize enterprise AI systems that balance autonomy, risk, explainability, and measurable outcomes.

### What I work on
- AI-powered decision systems in real enterprise workflows
- Governance-by-design: explainability, auditability, human-in-the-loop
- Discovery → operating model → production adoption

### Selected outcomes
- 28% attach-rate lift via governed conversational AI (Salesforce)
- ~3% churn reduction through AI-driven renewal intelligence (Palo Alto Networks)
- 30% on-time arrival improvement via ML-based field service optimization

### Current focus
- Agentic AI with decision boundaries
- Trust-first AI operating models
- Enterprise adoption & value realization
